# C++ snippets
While this started out as a design pattern repo and extending this will learning small modules and other usefull techniques. Not all of these will be original thoughts but implemented in my style with comments.

Sample illustratives codes for implmenting different design patterns and some comments about what could go wrong/right.


## List of Patterns

1. Adaptor
2. Decorator
3. Executor
4. Singleton
5. Factory
6. Visitor
7. CRTP

### Some good techniques not so much a pattern

1. Fluent
2. ScopeGuard


## List of future ideas to implement and test.

1. SharedPtr
2. Concurrent Rate Limiter
3. Task Scheduler
4. Exponential Backoff
5. Concurrent LinkedList

## Proving concurrency

1. Write test cases for concurrency and test using valgrind/TSAN.
